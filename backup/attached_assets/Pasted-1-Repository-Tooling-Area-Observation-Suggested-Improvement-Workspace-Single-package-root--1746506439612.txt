Suggested Improvement

Workspace

Single‑package root, but apps/, client/, and server/ behave like independent packages

Promote to a pnpm workspace / turborepo (root package.json ➜ workspaces:["apps/*","client","server","packages/*"]). Isolates deps, speeds CI caching, enables incremental builds

TypeScript

strict flags are off in tsconfig.json; a few implicit any escape

Turn on "strict":true (or at least noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks) then fix surfaced errors.  Safer APIs & better IntelliSense

Lint & Format

No repo‑wide ESLint config; relies on IDE defaults

Add eslint‑config‑turbo or eslint‑airbnb‑typescript, couple with Prettier via eslint-plugin-prettier for single‑pass formatting

Husky / lint‑staged

No pre‑commit checks

Add Husky hook to run pnpm lint, pnpm test – keeps main green

2 • Frontend (client/)

Routing

Uses Wouter which is lightweight but lacks data‑aware pre‑fetching.  If SEO isn’t a constraint consider staying; otherwise evaluate TanStack Router or React Router v6.22+ for nested routes & lazy loading.

Two identical routes (/course and /course#:problemSet) – could consolidate with a param‐based route.

Code‑Splitting & Suspense

All pages are imported eagerly in App.tsx.   Wrap each in React.lazy + <Suspense fallback={<Spinner/>}>. Shaves ~30‑40 kB initial JS.

Context Bloat

ThemeProvider,SolutionsProvider,LectureLinksProvider,CourseNameProvider all wrap the whole tree.  Deep provider stacks hurt render perf & readability.  Consider provider composition pattern: create a <AppProviders> component or colocate providers only where needed.

UI Components

Excellent use of shadcn/ui + Radix‑UI – but some duplicated styles under client/src/components/ui/*.  Prefer re‑exporting shadcn primitives via a local @/components/ui/index.ts barrel so consumers don’t guess at paths.

State / Data Fetching

Uses TanStack Query already – great.  A few useQuery calls use string keys like ["grades"].  Switch to key factories (gradesKeys.list(courseId)) to reduce cache‑key drift.

Accessibility & SEO

Confirm every interactive component has an aria‑label (some .button-icon spans rely on title attr only).

Add lang="en" to root index.html.
